                    <p>My name is Muhammmad Shoaib, I am a final year master's student in Data Science major from NED University, Karachi. I have done my Computer Science bachelor's degree in spring 2020. During my bachelor's education, I took part in software bootcamps where I sharpened my web and software development skills by creating small projects.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, during my bachelor's education, I started providing basic software development services in Fiverr. I am currently a level-one seller in Fiverr as a web and software developer. I have completed over 20 projects in Fiverr and had connections with two long-term clients who I worked with over 3 years and still connected to this date.</p>

                    <p>In my childhood, I always had interest in doing computer related activities. I used to play Yahoo games in my elder brother's account. I also had couple online friends from mIRC messaging application. Then there was this era where I spent most of my time playing Retro games in Sega, Mame32, and Neogeo emulators. I started using Facebook back in 2008 where I enjoyed group chats and playing games like Farmville, and Zynga Poker.
                    </p>

                    <p>Seeing my involvement with computer applications and video games, my parents and I decided to get a computer science degree and become a software engineer. And since then, I was never bored to learn and master technologies to become a professional software engineer.
